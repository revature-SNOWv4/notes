##  History of Angular

Angular is a **TypeScript-based open-source framework** used to develop **dynamic web applications**.

Angular is a [Single Page Application](./spa.md) (SPA) Framework. An SPA is a web application that fits on a single page. All our code (JavaScript , HTML , CSS ) is retrieved with a single page load. Navigation between pages is performed without refreshing the whole page.


### Angular Versions with release dates

* AngularJS or Angular 1 - October 20, 2010

**Angular** is commonly referred to as Angular 2+ or by one of the above versions, to distance the modern framework from the original AngularJS.

[AngularJS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS) is a **JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework**. It doesn't support the features of a server-side programming language, nor dynamic loading of the page. 

[Angular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_(web_framework)) is a **complete rewrite** of AngularJS. AngularJS was completely based on **controllers** and **scopes** whereas, Angular uses **component hierarchy** as its main architecture. 

### Angular JS vs Angular (Angularr 2+)

| Angular JS| Angular 4+|
| ------ | ------ |
| Uses MVC architecture to build the applications. |  Uses component based UI to build the applications.|
| AngularJS is written in JavaScript. | Angular is compatible with the most recent versions of TypeScript that have powerful type checking and object-oriented features. |
| To bind an image/property or an event with AngularJS, you have to remember the right ng directive. | Angular focuses on “( )” for event binding and “[ ]” for property binding.|
|AngularJS doesn't support mobiles. | Angular support mobiles. |

Angular uses the **TypeScript** language, which has features like :

* Static Typing
* Object-Oriented Programming based on classes
* Support for reactive programming using RxJS

The main building blocks of Angular are **modules**, **components**, **templates**, **metadata**, **data binding**, **directives**, **services**, and **dependency injection**. The following diagram shows how these building blocks of an Angular Application are related :

We'll discuss each block later in this section.
