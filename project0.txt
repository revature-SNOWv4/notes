Project 0:
due thurs. 1/20
presentations beginning at 10am est
On Tuesday: I will have another round of both 1 on 1's (afternoon) with a time limit on each 
    as well as selecting a few more p0s to see and a short review
QC: Wednesday 3:30pm est (week 2 - everything from typescript - angular - SDLC)

Basic Reqs due tuesday:

- Must be an angular project

- Must connect to a web api

- What the user sees from the api should depend on user input

- The website must have implement more than one route (routing)

- I would like api calls to be made by a service

- You can't use the pokemon api and I would like to see your website differentiate itself from mine
(ie I want to see something different than a list that the user searches/filters)
you can still include that feature but I wouldn't consider as satisfying the advanced array methods req
because i already did it

Once you complete these basic requirements (due Tues), you should work on:

- You must use the advanced array methods at least once at some point (map, filter, sort)

- Some angular testing
(doesnt need to be comprehensive - just a proof-of-concept is good enough)

- Must use stylesheets

Basic reqs: due tuesday
Advanced reqs: due thursday at presentation
the reason being tha in a real production environment you have both sprints and code freezes
code freeze: you can no longer work on implementation after a certain day
