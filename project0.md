Project 0:
must be an angular project
must connect either to a web api or a dummy api in postman
the api accesses must depend in some ways on interaction from the user (eg the user inputs what they want to see)
you must use the advanced array methods at least once at some point (map, filter, sort)
the website must have multiple routes that connect to the api in different ways
