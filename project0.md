Project 0:
- Must be an angular project
- Must connect either to a web api or a dummy api in postman
- The api accesses must depend in some ways on interaction from the user (eg the user inputs what they want to see)
- You must use the advanced array methods at least once at some point (map, filter, sort)
x The website must have multiple routes that connect to the api in different ways
must be creative and you can't use pokemons api
